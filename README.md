# Object-Detection
Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection using YOLO and Computer Vision
## Approach:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
a. Gather a dataset containing images of military and civilian scenarios with YOLO annotations.
b. Preprocess the dataset to ensure compatibility with the YOLO model.
2. Model Training:
a. Train a YOLO model to detect and classify multiple objects, including soldiers, weapons, vehicles, and trenches.
3. Real-Time Detection:
a. Deploy the trained model to detect objects in real-time video feeds or images.
4. Streamlit Integration:
a. Develop a user-friendly web interface for uploading images/videos and visualizing detection results.
5. Performance Evaluation:
a. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).
